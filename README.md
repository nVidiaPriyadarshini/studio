# Currency Converter App 
A simple app that converts currency quickly and simply. Generated using Firebase Studio
This project is a very basic project generated using Firebase studio that is used to convert a currency from one to another. A web-based interface for converting currency and getting the output value, for example, here displays converting the currency of the US dollar to INR.

Abstract: We see variations with different countries using different currencies. Be aware of the current exchange prices in the market and then can convert from one currency to another. A calculator-like application, developed using Firebase Studio. You also get a regular update when there’s a change in the value of the country’s currency and also the conversion rate.

People use this application basically for business, shares, and finance-related areas where currency exchange and money transfer happen daily. You get a preferred choice to convert any country’s currency. Just enter the amount, the currency to which you want to transform to, click enter and you get the output. The swap button helps switch the to/from currency choices with a single button click.
